Usage:
  scripts/init-llm-context.sh [TARGET_REPOSITORY]

Prints a compact initial prompt for an LLM agent after this collaboration
template has been copied into a repository. The script does not call an LLM,
read secrets, or make project architecture decisions.

You are working in this repository:
$target

Before implementing anything:
1. Read AGENTS.md.
2. Read docs/architecture/agent-quickstart.md.
3. Select the smallest safe operating path:
   - Fast Path for mechanical, local, deterministic work.
   - Feature Path for AT-TDD Phase 1, 2, or 3 feature work.
   - Architecture Path for ADRs, process changes, prompt changes, privacy-sensitive routing, or boundary decisions.
4. Read only the documents required by that path.
5. Read docs/architecture/io-reasoning-contracts.md when AI or model output is involved.
6. Check docs/architecture/implementation-readiness.md before Phase 1, 2, or 3.
7. If docs/collaboration/runtime-routing.toml exists, apply its review and
   implementation isolation and optional model identifiers. If it is missing,
   keep capability-class routing on the host agent and do not invent model
   names. After first adoption, recommend scripts/configure-ai-collaboration.sh
   rather than guessing. These settings do not replace Adjudicator approval.
8. Read docs/collaboration/project-conventions.md when present. It holds
   project facts and extra project rules. Do not store those in AGENTS.md.
   If it is missing, stop and ask to create it from
   docs/templates/project-conventions.md.
9. If a relied-on contract, architecture, or conventions file still contains
   an unfilled <...> placeholder, stop and ask the Adjudicator to set it.
   Do not treat placeholder text as a fact.
10. Read docs/collaboration/process-lessons.md and, when present, the live
   lessons log before design or implementation. Record review outcomes as
   meta-level lessons, not incident narratives.
11. When marking an issue or work plan done, run the same-context process
   review in docs/collaboration/process-review.md.

Use a compact design note for Fast Path work. Use the full [DESIGN CHECK] scaffold
for Feature Path and Architecture Path work.
Execute only the phase explicitly requested by the human Adjudicator.
Do not introduce target-project domain behavior, datastore choices, provider
choices, or stack-specific architecture unless an accepted specification or ADR
requires it.

If no target specification or phase has been provided yet, stop after design
intake and ask the Adjudicator for the missing specification or phase approval.

For later sessions and resume patterns, see
docs/collaboration/session-start-and-resume.md.
