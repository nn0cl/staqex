# AI-TDD Collaboration Gap Register

This register tracks collaboration-process gaps. It intentionally avoids
application-internal design.

## Purpose

Keep the AI-TDD plus human collaboration scheme honest by making missing
process controls visible.

## How to Use This Register

When starting a new project from this template, the gaps below are already
resolved by the included documents — keep them as a record of what the process
covers. Add a new entry whenever you find a real collaboration-process gap
(not an application feature gap) that this template does not yet address, and
resolve it the same way these were resolved: write the missing document, link
it here, and mark the status `resolved`.

## Gaps Covered By This Template

### 1. Definition of Done

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Agents need a clear stopping point for each phase.
- Adjudicators need a quick approval checklist.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/definition-of-done.md`.

### 2. Prompt and Instruction Change Control

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Agent behavior depends on prompts, instruction files, templates, and ADRs.
- Changes to these files can silently alter development behavior.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/prompt-instruction-change-control.md`.
- CI enforces that a pull request changing a contract file also adds a trace
  under `docs/collaboration/traces/`.

### 3. AI Work Trace Log

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Handoff notes capture a task ending, but not always the sequence of important
  choices during a task.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/ai-work-trace-log.md`.
- Store traces under `docs/collaboration/traces/`.
- Use `docs/templates/ai-work-trace.md`.

### 4. Evaluation and Golden Examples

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- AI-generated tests, summaries, and extraction outputs need regression checks.
- Without golden examples, quality can drift while still sounding plausible.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/evaluation-and-golden-examples.md`.
- Store examples under `docs/evaluation/golden-examples/`.
- Store criteria under `docs/evaluation/criteria/`.

### 5. Model and Tool Capability Matrix

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Tasks should route to the right model or tool, but the concrete matrix
  needs to be explicit rather than assumed.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/model-tool-capability-matrix.md`.

### 6. Privacy and Context Budget Policy

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Payload minimization is a goal, but needs a numeric or categorical budget to
  be enforceable.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/privacy-context-budget-policy.md`.

### 7. AI Failure and Recovery Procedure

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- The process says when to stop, but not how to recover from a bad AI turn.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/ai-failure-recovery.md`.

- Optional runner CLI contract for slow external AI jobs:
  `docs/collaboration/runner-cli-contract.md`.

### 8. Branch, Commit, and PR Discipline

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- AI-assisted work needs branch/commit conventions, not just a PR template.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/branch-commit-pr-discipline.md`.

### 9. Local Issue and Work Plan Management

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Planning needs issue dependencies and work order before coding starts.
- GitHub Issues may not be available during local or offline planning.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/local-issue-planning.md`.
- Store local issues under `docs/issues/`.
- Store multi-issue plans under `docs/work-plans/`.

### 10. Bug Planning and AI Usage Records

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Difficult bugs can span multiple AI attempts and should not live only in
  chat history.
- Later agents need a readable planning size and AI usage record before
  deciding how much reasoning is needed.
- Actual token usage is not available in every environment and should not be
  guessed.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/local-issue-planning.md`.
- Use `docs/collaboration/ai-work-trace-log.md`.


### 11. Issue Completion Document Synchronization

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Implementation and tests can be complete while the issue ledger remains at `proposed`.
- A stale issue ledger misleads the next agent about dependencies and current work.

Resolution:

- Use the Issue Status Synchronization section in `docs/collaboration/definition-of-done.md`.
- Include the issue and work-plan updates in the same reviewable unit as the implementation status change.

### 12. Runtime routing for review and implementation

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Adopters need to choose same-context review versus a separate-context
  subagent, and optional host-displayed models, without editing the shared
  contract or invoking a provider from a setup script.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/runtime-routing.md`.
- Store live choices in `docs/collaboration/runtime-routing.toml`.
- Create or refresh that file with `scripts/configure-ai-collaboration.sh`.


### 13. Meta-level process lessons and completion process review

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Review write-ups that replay one session do not transfer to the next task.
- Completing an issue without checking operating-contract deviations hides
  process debt.

Resolution:

- Use `docs/collaboration/process-lessons.md`.
- Use `docs/collaboration/process-review.md`.


### 14. Citation direction for context, ADRs, and work-management files

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Agents that load ISSUE or work-plan IDs from context files treat planning
  history as current rules.
- Context files that justify their own edits by linking to an ADR or ISSUE
  invert the evidence graph.

Resolution:

- Agents read current policy, ADRs, and specifications. They do not open
  ISSUES or work plans as the source of current rules.
- ADRs and specifications may cite ISSUES and work plans.
- Context files do not link to an ADR or ISSUE as the reason they changed.
- Copy/update exclude this template's `LISS-*.md`, `WP-*.md`, traces, and
  reviews.

### 15. Project conventions file

Status: resolved.

Why it matters:

- Project facts stored in template context files block template-authoritative
  updates of those files.

Resolution:

- Keep facts and extra project rules in
  `docs/collaboration/project-conventions.md`.
- Template context files are overwritten on sync and instruct agents to read
  the conventions file.

## Current Assessment

Ready enough to start design intake and Phase 1 work once the project's
architecture documents are filled in.

Ready for higher-volume parallel agent work now that gap 7 (AI failure and
recovery procedure) is resolved.
